## Story
This is my work on the WatiN source code. As one of my projects is still reusing the WatiN (it's a good library for automated testing) I needed to make some changes to the source code. I'm leaving some of the original things, but some of them will be removed.

## Planned roadmap
1. Reuse Nuget for the needed libraries.
2. Support for newer browsers:
    1. Firefox (without JSSH, need to find what should be used).
    2. Chrome (Jeroen started worked on it, but it's in reaaalllyyy unstable place).
    3. IE 11 (Windows 10), Edge. (I don't think that IE 10 will be necessary).
3. Fix tests (almost all of them).
4. Remove documentation links to original page.

## Credits
@Jeroen van Menen - for the awesome work on this.

## Notes
- I know that there are currently better options to automate browsers, but WatiN was so easy to use ;)
